# Network Intrusion Detection System Using Random Forest

## Project Overview
In today's interconnected world, protecting sensitive information from cyber threats is crucial. Our project aims to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using the Random Forest Algorithm. This advanced machine learning approach will efficiently identify unusual activities, detect suspicious patterns, and provide insights to prevent potential threats.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of network activity to detect unauthorized access attempts and suspicious behavior.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm for improved accuracy in detecting intrusions.
- **Scalability:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing security systems, ensuring scalability across various organizational sizes and network setups.
- **Adaptability:** Capable of adapting to new and emerging threats, enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience.
